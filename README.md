# Learning_Data_Science_with_Python
These are the course assignments and projects for **Learning Data Science with Python** at PKU, Spring 2024.

#### This repository includes:
* 17 assignments: Youâ€™ll find either the reference answers or my own solutions.
* 2 projects: The midterm and final projects. The midterm offers two topics to choose from, and I selected the first one.

#### Additional notes
* The assignments and projects vary each year and are designed by the current teaching assistants, so this content is provided solely for reference.
* I have not included the lecture slides due to copyright restrictions.
